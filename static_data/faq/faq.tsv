Why do some entries have more than one light and/or heavy chain sequence?	We are displaying any returned sequences that meet the threshold for comprising at least 30% of all Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) from that sample. It is now established that monoclonal hybridomas can express more than one light and/or heavy chain (e.g., Bradbury et al., MABS 10: 539, 2018). Moreover, a subset of these samples are not monoclonal but are oligoclonal, as indicated in the category title. Note that the aberrant light chain sequence derived from SP2/0 myeloma cell partner is not shown.	Question
