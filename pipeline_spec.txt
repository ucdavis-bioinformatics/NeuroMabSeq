Processing Folder:
    /share/biocore/projects/Trimmer_James_UCD/Hybridoma-Seq-Processing/

RawData Folder:
    /share/biocore/projects/Trimmer_James_UCD/Hybridoma-Seq-Processing/00-RawData


Folder Structure:
    00-RawData - contains a copy of all plates that need to be processed (as well as some testing data etc).
    01-Processing - contains an analysis folder for each processed plate 
    02-PostProcessing - contains across-runs analysis results


Pipeline:
    SampleSheet.txt is a 3 column file that defines the plates. It has three columns:
        filePrefix - prefix for the fastq files - formatting varies depending on DNA Tech Core naming
        plate: consistent naming (TRIMMER00NN_PNN) for output plates and associated tables.
        submissionID: contains the ID the submission system uses, this should be 12 random digits

1) Run setup_pipeline.py 
    1) load the SampleSheet.txt file
    2) for each sample
        - create an 01-Processing/TRIMMER00NN folder
        - link reads, copy in all of the important pieces
        - setup the scripts based on the primers used
            -run_pipeline.sh
            -01-build_hts.py
